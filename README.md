# PredictAI
# Note to self -> The entire project comments are low-quality made in 6/2023 in a rush when i was novice and starting out. 
    ((need to fix them later))

What is it built on?
1- Python (Flask)
2- HTML/CSS/JS
3- Microsoft SQL

# Installing
- Download the package or pull it from the repo.
- Installing the required python packages in 'Requirements.txt'.

# What Lessons Learnt From Project
1- It was wrong to use relational database for the project instead of just using JSON and parsing the data to AI model.
2- Refactoring the code and seperation of concerns.
3- Better ways to handle our scripts to work seamlessly instead of having to update the database manually each time. 
    (since script to download the latest files already exist.)
